Before I ever stepped into a boardroom, I worked with my hands. There’s a pride that comes from being able to point to a house and say, "I helped work on so and so project." Years in low-voltage cabling gave me a deep appreciation for real, visible results. But over time, as my career moved deeper into the corporate world, that satisfaction faded, replaced by metrics and meetings that rarely left a mark I could point to.

## Reclaiming Real Work in the Garden

A few years ago, I found my way back to tangible work through gardening. My garden became a refuge, something I could nurture, shape, and watch evolve. Each season gave me a new chance to get my hands dirty and reconnect with the pride of building something real. It felt like coming home to myself after years of setting that part of me aside for a more comfortable but less fulfilling path.

## The Challenge of Capturing the Journey

Now, several seasons in, the garden isn’t just about the plants. It’s about the journey. I’ve learned that every year brings new lessons, some wins, and plenty of setbacks. What’s surprised me most is how easy it is to let these stories slip away if I don’t make a conscious effort to capture them.

Logging and documenting my progress has proven harder than I expected. Planting seeds or fixing a tangled drip line is one thing, but pausing to write about what happened, what I felt, or what I learned is something else entirely. Life moves fast. It’s easy to let seasons blur together and lose sight of how much I’ve grown, both as a gardener and as a person.

## Why I’m Sharing My Stories Now

That’s why I’m starting this blog. I want to capture not just what grew or failed, but the journey itself. This is my way of pointing to the work I’m proud of, even if it’s not as obvious as a finished house. I want to remember the moments—big and small—that make gardening meaningful for me. Maybe my stories will help someone else who feels the same need to create something real or just needs a reminder that progress comes in seasons.

By documenting my journey, I’m holding myself accountable to keep learning and growing. And maybe, in sharing these stories, I’ll find the same sense of pride I once had on job sites, being able to say, "I did that," and knowing that the story is mine to keep.
