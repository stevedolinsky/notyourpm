At work, I manage complex programs that deliver millions of dollars of revenue. To a point that it makes me wonder why I'm just not in it for myself. Many people make a lot more money than I do and they can't even call a customer back in a timely manner. There used to be a mission, but now that mission appears to be at my best, 100% of the time, for other's payday.

That question comes up a lot for me these days. Do I let the world trample me into submission or do I write it off and do what I always knew I could do? Or do I choose to not participate and forge my own way? Maybe that's why my favorite movie is *There Will Be Blood*

I'm just getting this config off the ground, so this is a bit of a rant/test for the blog than anything else. But there are some days I agree with the below scene so much, and other's I disagree. Today is a day where I agree.

>**Daniel Plainview:** *Are you an angry man, Henry?*
>
>**Henry:** *About what?*
>
>**Daniel Plainview:** *Are you envious? D'you get envious?*
>
>**Henry:** *I don't think so. No.*
>
>**Daniel Plainview:** I have a competition in me. I want no one else to succeed. I hate most people.*
>
>**Henry:** *That part of me is gone. Working and not succeeding- all my, uh... failures has left me, uh... I just don't... care.*
>
>**Daniel Plainview:** *Well, if it's in me, it's in you. There are times when I... I look at people and I see nothing worth liking. I want to earn enough money I can get away from everyone.*
