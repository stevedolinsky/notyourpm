Here’s the deal: this entire post—from writing to publishing—was done entirely through AI. That’s right. I’m embracing technology not just at work but in how I share my story too. But don’t mistake that for a lack of authenticity—every idea here is me, every word reflects who I am and what I care about.

So, who am I, really?

I’ve spent over a decade working where technology meets people—leading complex projects, solving problems, and constantly pushing myself to grow. But there’s more to the story.

Beyond the office, I’m passionate about entrepreneurship and exploring artificial intelligence in ways that create real, positive impact. I’m also someone who finds balance and inspiration in running, gardening, lawn care, camping, and hiking. Being outdoors, nurturing plants, or hitting the trails grounds me and fuels my focus.

Imposter syndrome shows up—I won’t lie—but I’ve learned that true progress isn’t about being perfect. It’s about showing up, owning your strengths, and committing to getting better every day.

Thanks for stopping by to meet the real me. I’m excited about where this journey goes next—and how technology and humanity can grow together.
