I've been gardening for a few years now, starting with a community plot during COVID. I learned a lot, especially how much growth happens come July, making preparation key in the earlier months before you're just fighting nature. My Mom was a green thumb and this is how I keep her memory alive. I grew up on 4 acres and we had a nice garden plot I remember exploring as a young kid. I took all those veggies for granted, I ate so much cherry tomatos I wouldn't eat them for years! Now, I garden in the most polluted area in America, a few miles away from the only river in the country that is part of the top 1,000 polluted rivers in the world. I used to only be interested in growing veggies, there was a big part of me that only wanted to do something if there was a "productive" reason to do it (like getting food). Since then, I've come to enjoy flowers and the color they provide, because life isn't always about putting your nose to the grindstone, you can put an effort into something just so you can create a space that you enjoy and can enjoy a few breaths.
